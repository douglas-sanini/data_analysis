# DATA ANALYSIS
> This repository contains exercises that were applied in graduate course in statistics and data analysis

In the `notebooks` folder, a total a four jupyter_notebook files can be found. The first two are `Exercise List 1.ipynb` and `Exercise List 2.ipynb`. These two include assigned exercises to work on for this course. The files are pretty straightfoward, in which each will have listed all exercises and their respective solutions.

The other two files, `generating_random_numbers.ipynb` and `linear_interpolation.ipynb`, were pratice exercises in which our professor suggested in class to solve in order improve our programming with statistics skills. 

In the first one, `generating_random_numbers.ipynb`, is a code that generates random numbers for a given distribution. In the second one, `linear_interpolation.ipynb`, is a code that generates interpolated values for a function. 

Finally there is the `functions` folder which contains `functions.py` file that contains all fucntions that were required to create in order to complete Exercise Lists 1 and 2.
